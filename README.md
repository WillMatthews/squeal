# squeal


## What
Squeal is going to be an opinionated postgresql linter.

## Why
There is currently no good opinionated SQL linter.
I also fancy a golang project, and I want to try using codecov on something I'm making.

## How
Parse SQL -> apply formatting rules -> output clean SQL
Maybe use existing parsing from something like goose?

## When
Whenever I can find time in the upcoming months, I intend on breaking ground.
Progress should be good after that... right?
